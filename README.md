# clientServerAssignment

I developed a client/server communication protocol using TCP in
Python, gaining valuable insights into network programming, and strengthening my proficiency in the
language. This project allowed me to understand TCPâ€™s role in establishing reliable connections and data
transmission. I learned socket programming, error handling, and exception management.
